Pay attention to special instructions for parsing addresses, phone numbers, weight charges, disclaimers, and shipment line items. Ensure that data formats (especially numeric vs. text) remain consistent with the schema definitions, and parse disclaimers or special notes as an array of strings. Use field-level prompts to guide your extraction when confronting ambiguous or incomplete information, and maintain the document’s original data whenever possible.",
    "X-ReasoningPrompt": "Use this space to plan how to approach ambiguous or complicated fields in an air waybill. If phone numbers or addresses appear in multiple places, determine which corresponds to the correct field. Double-check numeric fields, such as weights and charges, to ensure numeric validity. When disclaimers span multiple lines, store each as a separate entry. For shipment line items, confirm that the pieces, weights, rates, and other details match the correct columns. Document any unresolved ambiguities, decide how to handle them, and finalize your extraction strategy here before populating the schema."
