    "Your task is to extract structured information from pitch decks based on the provided schema. Carefully analyze the content to identify relevant details and populate each field accurately while maintaining consistency across extracted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Guidelines:\n",
    "\t1.\tUnderstanding the Schema:\n",
    "\t•\tThe schema includes key entities such as the company, its investors, competitors, clients, team members, and business model. Each field must be carefully reviewed and filled with precise data extracted from the deck.\n",
    "\t•\tRelationships between companies (e.g., investor, competitor, client) should be determined based on contextual evidence within the deck.\n",
    "\t2.\tContextual Analysis:\n",
    "\t•\tConsider multiple slides to understand the startup's positioning, stakeholders, and market landscape.\n",
    "\t•\tExtract information by recognizing patterns, such as recurring names or mentions in key slides (e.g., cap tables for investors, competitive analysis for competitors, and traction slides for clients).\n",
    "\t3.\tConsistency and Accuracy:\n",
    "\t•\tEnsure extracted data is consistent across all fields and accurately reflects the content of the deck.\n",
    "\t•\tAvoid duplication or conflicting information by cross-referencing details from various slides.\n",
    "\t4.\tData Formatting:\n",
    "\t•\tCompany Name: Extract the official name as presented in the deck, ensuring correctness.\n",
    "\t•\tWebsite: Extract and format URLs correctly \n",
    "\t•\tCountry: Convert to the appropriate two-letter country code for uniformity.\n",
    "\t•\tBusiness Model: Determine whether the startup follows B2B, B2C, or C2C based on their product offerings and customer base.\n",
    "\t5.\tHandling Team Data:\n",
    "\t•\tIdentify key team members, ensuring correct extraction of their first name, last name, title, and previous experiences.\n",
    "\t•\tPrioritize executives and founding members when available.\n",
    "\t6.\tDealing with Missing Information:\n",
    "\t•\tIf some details are not explicitly stated, infer them based on available context or leave them blank if they cannot be determined with certainty.\n",
    "\t•\tEnsure no assumptions are made beyond what is supported by the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extraction Output:\n",
    "\t•\tThe extracted data should strictly adhere to the defined schema, ensuring each field is correctly populated according to its description.\n",
    "\t•\tThe output should be structured, with proper data types (e.g., strings, enumerations, lists) and validated before final submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these principles, the extracted information will be comprehensive, accurate, and aligned with the expected data structure for further processing and analysis.\n",
