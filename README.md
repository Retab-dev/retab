### What is Retab?

Retab solves all the major challenges in document processing with LLMs:

1. **Universal Document Preprocessing**: Convert any file type (PDFs, Excel, emails, etc.) into LLM-ready format without writing custom parsers
2. **Structured, Schema-driven Extraction**: Get consistent, reliable outputs using schema-based prompt engineering
3. **Processors**: Publish a live, stable, shareable document processor.
4. **Automations**: Create document processing workflows that can be triggered by events (mailbox, upload link, endpoint, outlook plugin).
5. **Evaluations**: Evaluate the performance of models against annotated datasets
6. **Optimizations**: Identify the most used processors and help you finetune models to reduce costs and improve performance



We are offering you all the software-defined primitives to build your own document processing solutions. We see it as **Stripe** for document processing.

Our goal is to make the process of analyzing documents and unstructured data as **easy** and **transparent** as possible.

Many people haven't yet realized how powerful LLMs have become at document processing tasks - we're here to help **unlock these capabilities**.
