### How it works

UiForm solves all the major challenges in document processing with LLMs:

1. **Universal Document Processing**: Convert any file type (PDFs, Excel, emails, etc.) into LLM-ready format without writing custom parsers
2. **Structured, Schema-driven Extraction**: Get consistent, reliable outputs using schema-based prompt engineering
3. **Deployments**: Create custom mailboxes and links to process documents at scale
4. **Evaluations**: Evaluate the performance of models against annotated datasets
5. **Optimizations**: Identify the most used deployments and help you finetune models to reduce costs and improve performance



We are offering you all the software-defined primitives to build your own document processing solutions. We see it as **Stripe** for document processing.

Our goal is to make the process of analyzing documents and unstructured data as **easy** and **transparent** as possible.

Many people haven't yet realized how powerful LLMs have become at document processing tasks - we're here to help **unlock these capabilities**.

## How it works

UiForm allows you to easily create document processing deployments. Here is the general workflow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User ->> UiForm: File Upload
    UiForm -->> UiForm: Preprocessing
    UiForm ->> AI Provider: Request on your behalf
    AI Provider -->> UiForm:  Structured Generation
    UiForm ->> Webhook: Send result
    UiForm ->> User: Send Confirmation
```

## General philosophy

Our goal is to : 
<Steps>
  <Step title="Document Processing">
    Helping you leverage OpenAI API to do document processing tasks with structured generations
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deployment">
    Create custom mailboxes and links connected to your webhooks to process documents at scale
  </Step>
  <Step title="Optimization">
    Identify the most used deployments and help you finetune models to reduce costs and improve performance
  </Step>
</Steps>

We currently support [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview), [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/api), [Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/) and [xAI](https://x.ai/api) models.

You come with your own API key from your favorite AI provider, and we handle the rest.
