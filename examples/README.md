Examples of common tasks and use-cases with [Retab API](https://docs.retab.dev/core/Core_Concepts).

To run these examples, you will need:
- a Retab account and associated API key ([create your API key on the Retab Developer Dashboard here](https://www.retab.dev/dashboard/settings))

- a model provider - for example, an OpenAI account and associated API key ([create your account here](https://auth.openai.com/create-account))

Set an environment variable called `RETAB_API_KEY` with your API key. Alternatively, in most IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, you can create an .env file at the root of your repo containing `RETAB_API_KEY=<your API key>`, which will be picked up by the notebooks.

Most code examples are written in Python, though the concepts can be applied in any language.
