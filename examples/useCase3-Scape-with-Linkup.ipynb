As a result of these new requirements, NVIDIA incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the demand for H20 diminished. Sales of H20 products were $4.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 prior to the new export licensing requirements. NVIDIA was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 revenue in the first quarter.\\n\\nFor the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 60.5% and 61.0%, respectively. Excluding the $4.5 billion charge, first quarter non-GAAP gross margin would have been 71.3%.\\n\\nFor the quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.76 and $0.81, respectively. Excluding the $4.5 billion charge and related tax impact, first quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share would have been $0.96.\\n\\n‚ÄúOur breakthrough Blackwell NVL72 AI supercomputer ‚Äî a ‚Äòthinking machine‚Äô designed for reasoning‚Äî is now in full-scale production across system makers and cloud service providers,‚Äù said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. ‚ÄúGlobal demand for NVIDIA‚Äôs AI infrastructure is incredibly strong. AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate. Countries around the world are recognizing AI as essential infrastructure ‚Äî just like electricity and the internet ‚Äî and NVIDIA stands at the center of this profound transformation.‚Äù\\n\\nNVIDIA will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share on July 3, 2025, to all shareholders of record on June 11, 2025.\\n\\n**Q1 Fiscal 2026 Summary**\\n\\n**GAAP**\\n\\n_($ in millions, except earnings_  \\n_per share)_\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n**Q1 FY26**\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n**Q4 FY25**\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n**Q1 FY25**\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n**Q/Q**\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n**Y/Y**\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nRevenue\\n\\n$44,062\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$39,331\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$26,044\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n12%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n69%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nGross margin\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n60.5%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n73.0%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n78.4%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(12.5) pts\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(17.9) pts\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nOperating expenses\\n\\n$5,030\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$4,689\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$3,497\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n7%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n44%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nOperating income\\n\\n$21,638\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$24,034\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$16,909\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(10)%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n28%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nNet income\\n\\n$18,775\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$22,091\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$14,881\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(15)%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n26%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nDiluted earnings per share\\\\*\\n\\n$0.76\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$0.89\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$0.60\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(15)%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n27%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n**Non-GAAP**\\n\\n_($ in millions, except earnings_  \\n_per share)_\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n**Q1 FY26**\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n**Q4 FY25**\\n\\n*   Revenue is expected to be $45.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. This outlook reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8.0 billion due to the recent export control limitations.\\n*   GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 71.8% and 72.0%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The company is continuing to work toward achieving gross margins in the mid-70% range late this year.\\n*   GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $5.7 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. Full year fiscal 2026 operating expense growth is expected to be in the mid-30% range.\\n*   GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense are expected to be an income of approximately $450 million, excluding gains and losses from non-marketable and publicly-held equity securities.\\n*   GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 16.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items.\\n\\n**Highlights**  \\nNVIDIA achieved progress since its previous earnings announcement in these areas:\\xa0\\n\\n**Data Center**\\n\\n*   First-quarter revenue was $39.1 billion, up 10% from
