## âœ¨ Whatâ€™s in Here

| File | Approach | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `pydantic_calendar_event.py` | **Pydantic** | We define a `CalendarEvent` schema using Python classes with field-level control and built-in validation. We would recommend it for Python developers. |
| `json_schema_calendar_event.py` | **JSON Schema** | The same use case, but using raw JSON Schema as a Python dictionary â€” ideal for non-Python contexts or integration-first workflows. |
