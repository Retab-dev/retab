## 🏢 Airbnb Pitch Deck Extraction

We provide you here with an end-to-end example of using Retab to extract structured insights from a PDF — we take the AirBnB pitch deck as an example.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `airbnb_schema.py` | Schema definition for extracting investors, competitors, clients, team, and business model |
| `run_airbnb_extraction.py` | Loads the schema, analyzes a pitch deck with OpenAI, and prints the structured output |
